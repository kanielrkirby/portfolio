        <h2>Hey there!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Kaniel Kirby, a 20-year-old web developer from Abilene, Texas. I
            have a passion for creating beautiful, user-friendly websites that
            are interactive and visually engaging. I am proficient in
            React-Typescript, a tech stack I use to build and design user
            interfaces that are as functional as they are aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not building websites, I enjoy drinking coffee, making
            music, and biking. I aspire to build a career around my skills and
            talents in web development by creating functional and engaging
            websites for my clientele. I enjoy working in a team setting and
            leading projects. Being flexible and always willing to learn new
            things, I quickly adapt to new technologies and techniques to ensure
            my clients are satisfied with their results.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began programming because I wanted to build websites the right
            way. I believe every client deserves a website that is built with
            the kind of care and passion that I put into my projects. Tired of
            outdated, clunky web pages? So am I. I want to work with you every
            step of the way as I create a personalized website that is
            accessible for you and your consumers.
