        <h2>Hey there!</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Kaniel Kirby, a 20-year-old web developer from Abilene, Texas. I
          have a passion for creating beautiful, user-friendly websites that are
          interactive and visually engaging. I am proficient in
          React-Typescript, a tech stack I use to build and design user
          interfaces that are as functional as they are aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not building websites, I enjoy drinking coffee, making music,
          and biking. I aspire to build a career around my skills and talents in
          web development by creating functional and engaging websites for my
          clientele. I enjoy working in a team setting and leading projects.
          Being flexible and always willing to learn new things, I quickly adapt
          to new technologies and techniques to ensure my clients are satisfied
          with their results.
        </p>
        <p>
          I began programming because I wanted to build websites the right way.
          I believe every client deserves a website that is built with the kind
          of care and passion that I put into my projects. Tired of outdated,
          clunky web pages? So am I. I want to work with you every step of the
          way as I create a personalized website that is accessible for you and
          your consumers.
